description: "Data for one sample on a high-throughput wafer produced by Neel.\n The extracted data includes the x- and y- position of the sample on the wafer, the chemical elementals measured by EDX and the coercivity measured by MOKE.\n The sample is a NdCeFeB_2-5 alloy. MOKE measurements could have been not performed for all samples, so the value for coercivity is optional.


A juypter-notebook showing how to handle the data can be found next to the raw data.
